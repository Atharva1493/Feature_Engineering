# Feature Engineering on the Titanic Dataset

This repository contains code and documentation for performing feature engineering on the Titanic dataset. Feature engineering is a critical step in preparing data for analysis and modeling, as it involves creating new features that can enhance the performance of machine learning models.

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including their survival status, age, fare, and other attributes. This project focuses on feature engineering to create new variables that can improve the performance of machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
